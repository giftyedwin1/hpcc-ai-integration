# HPCC AI Integration

Connects HPCC Systems clusters to AI assistants for natural-language → ECL
workflows. The core is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server exposing HPCC tools;
on top of it are ready-to-use "ECL Expert" configurations for three clients.

## Quick start

1. **Set up the MCP server** — see [`mcp-server/README.md`](mcp-server/README.md)
   (create the venv, install deps, start the `kubectl` port-forwards).
2. **Pick your client:**
   - **Amazon Quick Desktop** — connect the MCP server under
     Settings → Capabilities → Connectors → MCP Servers, then import
     `quick/ecl-expert/SKILL.md` as a Skill.
   - **Kiro CLI** — run `kiro-cli chat --agent ecl-expert` from this directory
     (the agent in `.kiro/` embeds the server and references the skill).
   - **GitHub Copilot CLI** — run `copilot` from this directory. It picks up the
     `hpcc` server from `.mcp.json` and the agent from `.github/agents/`. Verify
     with `/mcp show` (lists `hpcc`), then `/agents` to select **ECL Expert**.
     Runs locally, so it reaches the same `kubectl` port-forwards as Kiro.

## What's shared vs client-specific

- **Shared:** the MCP server (`mcp-server/`) — all clients launch the same
  `server.py` and get the same 16 HPCC tools.
- **Client-specific:** the "ECL Expert" skill/agent. Each client uses a different
  format and tool-naming convention, so each has its own copy:
  - Quick: markdown-header `SKILL.md`, `hpcc_cluster__<tool>` names, `load_skill`.
  - Kiro: YAML-frontmatter `SKILL.md`, `@hpcc/<tool>` names, loaded via `skill://`.
  - Copilot CLI: `.agent.md` agent (frontmatter + prompt body, no separate skill),
    `hpcc/*` tool refs, MCP server in `.mcp.json` (`mcpServers` key, `type: stdio`).

> Note: Amazon Quick's MCP client uses **tools only** (resources/prompts are
> ignored), so the Quick experience is delivered through the imported Skill.
> Kiro CLI and GitHub Copilot CLI support the full MCP protocol plus their own
> agents. The Copilot CLI agent runs locally (interactive, like Kiro), reaching
> the same port-forwarded cluster; it is not the GitHub.com cloud coding agent,
> which runs on a hosted runner and could not reach a local cluster.
